## Project Overview

This project implements a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using the famous Iris dataset, we train machine learning models to classify flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The project walks through data exploration, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps, providing an end-to-end approach to classification problems.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** The dataset used is the Iris Flower Dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning classification tasks, containing 150 samples across three species.
- **Columns:**
  - `Sepal Length (cm)`
  - `Sepal Width (cm)`
  - `Petal Length (cm)`
  - `Petal Width (cm)`
  - `Species`: The class label representing the species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### Key Insights

1. **Data Distribution:**
   - The dataset contains balanced classes with 50 samples of each species.
   - Sepal and petal measurements provide clear distinctions between Setosa and the other two species, while Versicolor and Virginica exhibit overlapping feature values.
   
2. **Correlation Between Features:**
   - Strong correlations were observed between petal length and petal width, as well as sepal length and petal length, making these features critical for classification.
   
3. **Species Separation:**
   - Using pair plots, Setosa can be clearly separated from Versicolor and Virginica, while the latter two require more sophisticated modeling for accurate classification.

### Model Training and Evaluation

We trained and evaluated two classification algorithms:

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **MLP Classifier**


The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The MLP Classifier model performed the best with an accuracy score of over 100%, making it the optimal choice for this task.

### Visualizations

- **Pair Plot of Features:** A scatter plot matrix showing the relationship between the four features and their correlation with each species.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of the classification results, showing how well the models performed across the three species.
